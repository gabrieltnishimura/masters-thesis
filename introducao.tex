The research and advancement of scientific knowledge can be very daunting, especially without a scientific background. In the past, an individual willing to contribute may have had difficulties, but nowadays the technology advancement and connectivity made

However, even for these individuals, there are some ways in which they can help: Citizen Science provides a gateway to contribution

research that engages nonprofessionals in the process of creating new scientific knowledge \cite{asd}.

One century ago, Citizen Science was mostly related to ecological and enviromental sciences. Cooperative Weather Service (started in 1890), the National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count (1900;), the North American Breeding Bird Survey (1966;), and the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (1976).

These and other successful citizen science projects have increased ecological and environmental knowledge at large geographic scales and at high temporal resolution (McKinley et al. 2015).

Citizen Science refers to research that engages nonprofessionals in the process of creating new scientific knowledge (Bonney et al. 2014)

Here are four common features of citizen science practice: (a) anyone can participate, (b) participants use the same protocol so data can be combined and be high quality, (c) data can help real scientists come to real conclusions and (d) a wide community of scientists and volunteers work together and share data to which the public, as well as scientists, have access. 


Citizen science – research that engages non- professionals in the process of creating new scientific knowledge (Bonney et al. 2014) – has expanded greatly in the past decade (Figure 1; McKinley et al. 2015). Rising interest in this approach has been fueled in part by rapid technological developments (Newman et al. 2012), by policy and management needs for large- scale and long-term monitoring datasets (Conrad and Hilchey 2011), and by increased emphasis on science outreach and education (Silvertown 2009). While citizen-science projects vary widely in their subject mat- ter, objectives, activities, and scale (Figures 2–4; Wiggins and Crowston 2015), one common goal is the produc- tion of reliable data that can be used for scientific purposes.

The ecological and environmental sciences have been leaders in citizen science, boasting some of the longest- running projects that have contributed meaningful data to science and conservation, including the Cooperative Weather Service (first year of data collection: 1890), the National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count (1900; >200 publications have relied on the resulting data set), the North American Breeding Bird Survey (1966; >670 publications), the leafing and flowering times of US lilacs and honeysuckles (1956; >50 publications; Rosemartin et al. 2015), and the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (1976; >100 publications). These and other successful citizen science projects have increased ecological and environmental knowledge at large geographic scales and at high temporal resolution (McKinley et al. 2015).

A citizen scientist is a volunteer who collects and/or processes data as part of a scientific enquiry. Projects that involve citizen scientists are burgeoning, particularly in ecology and environmental sciences, although the roots of citizen science go back to the very beginnings of modern science itself.

“Citizen science,” a range of participatory models for involving nonprofessionals as collaborators in scientific research, is receiving increased attention for its ongoing successes. Citizen science is well developed in fields like ecology and astronomy, where there is a long history of nonprofessionals making substantive contributions to the scholarly knowledge base. Western health and biomed- ical research have historically had a different relationship to nonprofessionals (as subjects or service recipients), however, with protective regulations and oversight further constraining interactions between parties. 

He is not alone. Citizen science is now mainstream, with hundreds of thousands of participants worldwide contributing observations of the natural world to various citizen science projects daily. Among the most popular projects, accumulating millions of observations annually, are those in which citizen scientists record the numbers and types of organisms observed [1,2].

For many fields of science, it is unavoidable gathering and analyzing large amounts of data to research a subject. To ensure these requirements, scientists often collaborate with normal citizens. 
In conventional scenarios, a strict method is used to extract, process and analyze the data.

Natural language processing is a vast field that explores how computers can understand and manipulate human language in text or speech format. Researches in this area include (but are not limited to) sentiment analysis, sentence prediction, text translation, text-to-speech conversion and voice recognition. Voice recognition in particular is a class of machine learning that can be stochastically modelled - using Hidden Markov Models \cite{gales2008application} -, Neural Networks \cite{graves2013speech} or even non-stochastically \cite{burget2003nonrandomattr}.

However, these voice modeling strategies are highly dependant on the quality and quantity of data provided. Factors such as noisy speech data, non-homogeneous recordings, different microphones within the same data set and even speech disorders could limit proper analysis, affect accuracy and even change speech predictions. 

However, the applicability of these strategies is either compromised or ameliorated by the quality and quantity of data used in training stages. Factors such as noisy speech data, non-homogeneous recordings, different microphones within the same data set and even speech disorders could limit proper analysis, affect accuracy and even change speech predictions.

There are many robust data sets available in the literature, such as TIMIT \cite{Lamel1992timmit}, DIRHA \cite{Ravanelli2016dirha} and the more recent \cite{chanchaochai2018globaltimit}. These data sets are called Speech Corpora and have a collection of audio recordings of spoken language. Some of them also have additional text files containing transcriptions of the words spoken. Unfortunately, most speech corpora are for the English language \cite{LeRouxVincent2014TRdatasets} and the literature on the Speech Corpora creation itself is sparse.

This work focuses on 

To fill this gap, this work presents a systematic literature review of speech corpora to define its characteristics and requirements when creating this kind of data set.

\chapter{Objective}

The main focus of this article lies in defining what characterizes a good and robust speech dataset.

The secondary focus of this work applies what was defined as a robust dataset to generate one in Brazilian Portuguese, uploading it to a public repository.
