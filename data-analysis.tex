\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{chap:proposal-data-analysis}

The data analysis will occur during the public submission period, and will end after 1 month of recordings. This analysis will create a first version of the Fale Alguma Coisa Speech Corpus, which will be published in section \ref{chap:proposal-data-publication}. This process will be thoroughly documented, so it may be reproduced afterwards to add more recordings to a more recent version of the corpus.

This data analysis consists in 4 main steps: (1) definition of recording structure, (2) filtering of unusable recordings, (3) association of the user metadata with the recordings, (4) statistical analysis to ensure data quality.
