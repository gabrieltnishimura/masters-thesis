\chapter[Proposal]{Proposal}
\label{chap:proposal}

This proposal focuses on detailing the necessary steps to the creation and publication of a crowdfunding speech corpus in Brazilian Portuguese. To this end, a virtual voice recording application will be developed (chapter \ref{chap:proposal-application}), focusing on adding gamification elements to enhance user engagement. Additionally, this application will also extract some relevant speaker characteristics found in the systematic literature review in chapter \ref{chap:related-work}, such as speaker demographics. Once the construction is finished, the application will be released, allowing general public submission (in chapter \ref{chap:proposal-public-submission}). After the submission period, the collected data will be analyzed and compiled to a speech corpus (chapter \ref{chap:proposal-data-analysis}), which will be publicized to an open-source repository in chapter \ref{chap:proposal-data-publication}.
