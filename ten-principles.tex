\chapter{Ten principles of citizen science}
\label{app:ten-principles}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Citizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific endeavour that generates new knowledge or understanding. 
    \subitem Citizens may act as contributors, collaborators or as project leaders and have a meaningful role in the project.
    \item Citizen science projects have a genuine science outcome. For example, answering a research question or informing conservation action, management decisions or environmental policy.
    \item Both the professional scientists and the citizen scientists benefit from taking part. Benefits may include the publication of research outputs, learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, satisfaction through contributing to scientific evidence, for example, to address local, national and international issues, and through that, the potential to influence policy.
    \item Citizen scientists may, if they wish, participate in multiple stages of the scientific process. This may include developing the research question, designing the method, gathering and analysing data, and communicating the results.
    \item Citizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and what the research, policy or societal outcomes are.
    \item Citizen science is considered a research approach like any other, with limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides opportunity for greater public engagement and democratisation of science.
    \item Citizen science project data and metadata are made publicly available and where possible, results are published in an open-access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this.
    \item Citizen scientists are acknowledged in project results and publications.
    \item Citizen science programmes are evaluated for their scientific output, data quality, participant experience and wider societal or policy impact.
    \item The leaders of citizen science projects take into consideration legal and ethical issues surrounding copyright, intellectual property, data-sharing agreements, confidentiality, attribution and the environmental impact of any activities.
