In this section, we discuss how the literature has treated speech corpora creation, as well as the various conditions and variables considered in the process. Speech Corpus crafting itself is well established in the literature by TIMIT \cite{Lamel1992timmit} and SWITCHBOARD \cite{godfrey1992switchboard}. TIMIT creates a dataset of 6300 utterances by 630 speakers from different regions of the United States. The sentences were crafted to fit in one of the three categories: 1) dialect "shibboleth", 2) phonemically compact and 3) phonetically diverse, but the selection itself was not well defined. Nevertheless, it is a very robust dataset with a time-aligned transcription and a usage guide to automatic speech recognition applications.

The CHiME articles \cite{christensen2010chime} \cite{barker2013pascal}, \cite{barker2018fifth} (and more), are also source of structured speech corpora creation, challenging researchers to better recognize speech within a everyday listening environment using multiple distant microphones. Since the focus of these works lies on nonoptimal recording conditions, detailed information on the noise background, noise level, recording style and speech material has been provided, as well as comprehensive postprocessing work.

A more recent work by \cite{chanchaochai2018globaltimit} attempts to extend the TIMIT functionality to other languages, by providing a method to create "TIMIT-like" datasets. These datasets are caracterized by having 1) Multiple (anonymously) identified speakers, 2) Wide range of phonetically representative inputs, 3) Wideband recordings with good acoustic quality, 4) Time-aligned lexical and phonemic transcripts and 5) Easily availability to anyone. The authors detail the speakers and sessions, the text corpus selection process, the recording procedures, as well as the transcription and alignment methods. At the moment, there have been five datasets created, with more planned or in progress.
